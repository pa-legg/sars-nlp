The glossary code XXGVTXX is used when 
requiring a defence under POCA (‘consent’) if the value of the
suspected money laundering falls below a value of £3,000.
Use code XXGVTXX in any SAR relating to suspected money laundering where the 
activity value is £3,000 or less and you are unaware of any law enforcement or 
terrorist financing interest at the time of reporting.
Law enforcement interest does not have to be confirmed and could for example be 
an article that has appeared in the press or on social media as well as an 
awareness of a previous interest.
In addition, the victim code XXVICTXX should not be used concurrently with the 
XXGVTXX code. If the majority of funds are less than £3,000 and being returned to 
a victim of crime, please only use the victim code. 
The UKFIU is committed to ensuring a risk–based and consistent approach to 
decision making and operates a triage system for DAMLs in date order. The 
introduction of this code is to assist with the triage processes and the early 
identification of key-risk areas and asset recovery opportunities.

The glossary code XXPRFXX is used when Professional enablers: persons providing professional services or
specialist knowledge that wittingly or unwittingly facilitates money laundering.
The laundering of criminal proceeds is sometimes reliant on access to the 
professional skills of, among others, lawyers, accountants, investment bankers and 
company formation agents. Professional enablers can also be highly organised 
criminals who develop products and services specifically to facilitate criminal 
enterprises. The use of professional enablers increases the complexity of money 
laundering activities, for example with the setting up of shell companies, trusts and 
other instruments providing anonymity. 
The 2015 National Risk Assessment (NRA) describes professional enablers as those 
persons having the skills and/or knowledge to (wittingly or unwittingly) assist 
criminals in laundering the proceeds of crime.
Professionals can effectively act as private banks to individual clients. Client 
accounts offer criminals relative anonymity, the ability to obscure the origins and 
beneficiaries of criminal proceeds, and the perceived protection of legal privilege. 
The hallmarks of money laundering facilitated by professional service providers are 
very visible in trust and company formation, conveyancing and client account 
services environment.

The glossary code XXTBMLXX is used in cases involving Trade-based money laundering (TBML).
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as “the process of disguising 
the proceeds of crime and moving value through the use of trade transactions in an 
attempt to legitimise their illicit origins”.
4 At its core, it relates to the use of the 
international trade system to obscure the origin of illicitly obtained funds.

The glossary code XXPROPXX is used when Purchase, sale and rental of real estate property
Purchasing, selling and renting real estate property as a method of money 
laundering provides the criminal with the opportunity to clean large amounts of 
illicit funds in a single transaction. It is likely that a significant proportion of 
criminals purchase or sell property through estate agents to launder the proceeds 
of crime. Other professionals, in particular solicitors and conveyancers, are likely to 
be wittingly or unwittingly involved.
Real estate property could include dwelling houses, apartments or flats, commercial 
buildings such as office or factory premises. It can also include investments in 
property developments that build dwelling or commercial premises.

The glossary code XXVAXX is used when there is suspicion that virtual assets are being used for money laundering.
FATF, Regulation of virtual assets’, 19 October 2018. 
The FATF defines virtual assets as digital representations of value that can be 
digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment 
purposes, including digital representations of value that function as a medium of 
exchange, a unit of account and/or a store of value.5
The UKFIU is using the term virtual assets in line with changes to the FATF 
Recommendations and the FATF Glossary that have added new definitions of 
“virtual assets” and “virtual asset service providers”. It is the more allencompassing term since it includes virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies and digital 
currencies, but also covers the fact that anything can be tokenised as an asset and 
transferred on a blockchain or other digital peer-to-peer format.
Offering a secure, anonymous method of transferring value, with global reach, fast 
transaction times and low fees, virtual assets provide a powerful tool for criminals 
to move and store illicit funds. While they have the potential to spur financial 
innovation, efficiency and improve financial inclusion, they also create new 
opportunities for criminals and terrorists to launder their proceeds or finance their 
illicit activities. 
The main criminal use of virtual assets is as a method of payment for illicit 
commodities and services, particularly on the dark web. On the whole, SARs on 
virtual assets link to fraud, dark web market places and suspicions surrounding 
unusual third party payments swiftly transferred to exchanges. 
The role virtual assets are increasingly playing in money laundering, the 
investigative challenges associated with tracing illicit virtual asset transactions and 
the lack of regulation all continue to pose considerable risks. The scale of value 
laundered through virtual assets is unknown, and while it is assessed to be 
relatively low compared to other methods, it is expected to increase as new types 
of virtual assets continue to emerge and their use becomes more widespread.
Please note that the use of virtual assets/virtual 
currencies/cryptocurrencies/digital currencies is not illegal. This code 
relates to where there is a suspicion that virtual assets are being used to 
facilitate money laundering. The visibility of virtual assets in isolation 
should not automatically suggest that a SAR is required.

The glossary code XXD9XX is used when suspicion involves Bribery and corruption.
The UK Anti-Corruption Strategy 2017-2022 states that “there is no universally 
accepted definition of corruption, but it is generally understood to involve the abuse 
of office and position to benefit a third party (an individual, business or other 
organisation), in return for payment or other reward. These features are captured 
in Transparency International’s definition: ‘the misuse of entrusted power for 
personal gain’”. In view of the public profile of persons in a prominent public function it is likely that 
they would wish to avail themselves of a sophisticated smokescreen to conceal their 
corrupt illicit corrupt gains. Bribery and corruption therefore have significant links to 
money laundering.
