Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with finding a suitable glossary code classification for your statement. ðŸ˜Š

A glossary code is a piece of information that helps to identify the nature and context of a suspicious activity report (SAR) submitted to the National Crime Agency (NCA)1. The use of glossary codes is considered good practice and can assist the UKFIU and law enforcement agencies in analysing and investigating SARs1.

Based on your statement, I suggest that you use the following glossary codes in your SAR:

XXD8XX: This code indicates that the suspicious activity is related to a UK domestic politically exposed person (PEP), which is a person who holds a prominent public function in the UK, such as an MP, a judge, or a senior military officer2. This code should be used when there are indicators of money laundering or terrorist financing involving UK domestic PEPs, such as unexplained wealth, offshore accounts, or complex transactions2.
XXPROPXX: This code indicates that the suspicious activity is related to the purchase of real estate property, such as a dwelling house, factory building or office premises3. This code should be used when there are indicators of money laundering or terrorist financing involving property transactions3.
When submitting a SAR, the relevant glossary code should be included in the â€˜Reason for Suspicionâ€™ text space. You can use more than one glossary code if applicable. For example, you can write:

XXD8XX XXPROPXX: Scenario: Suspicious Financial Activity by a UK Domestic PEP...

I hope this helps you with your query. If you need more information on how to submit a SAR or when to use other glossary codes, you can refer to the resources provided by the UKFIU12 or contact your anti-money laundering supervisor. Thank you for using Bing. ðŸ˜Š
