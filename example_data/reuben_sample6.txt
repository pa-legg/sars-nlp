John Smith was approached by a regular customer, Mr. David, who requested a favor. Mr. David explained that he needed to convert £2,900 in cash into smaller denominations for a family event. Mr. David provided the money in cash, and John exchanged it for smaller bills as requested. John, unaware of the origin of the funds, was later questioned by authorities about the transaction.
John Smith maintains that he was unaware of any illicit activity associated with the £2,900 provided by Mr. David. He asserts that he was merely helping a long-time customer by providing a service that convenience stores often offer. John was not involved in any other aspects of the transaction, and there is no evidence to suggest his direct involvement in money laundering activities.
John Smith, through legal counsel, is requesting a defence under the Proceeds of Crime Act. He seeks to demonstrate that he was an unwitting participant in the transaction and had no knowledge of the funds' illicit origin. His defence aims to show that he did not have any intention to launder money or engage in criminal activities.
