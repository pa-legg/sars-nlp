Can you please suggest a suitable glossary code classification for the following statement: The Essex lorry immigrant disaster, also known as the Essex lorry tragedy, was a heartbreaking and highly publicized event that occurred on October 23, 2019, in Grays, Essex, United Kingdom. The incident shocked the world as it revealed the horrific realities of human trafficking and the risks that migrants and asylum-seekers often face in their desperate pursuit of a better life. In this tragic event, 39 Vietnamese nationals, including men, women, and teenagers, lost their lives inside a refrigerated container truck. The victims had been smuggled into the UK in extremely harsh and dangerous conditions. The investigation showed that they had endured suffocating and freezing temperatures during their journey, and the overcrowded container lacked proper ventilation.

 Based on your information, if I am asked to classify a report containing reasons for suspicion including human trafficking, smuggling of migrants, harsh and dangerous conditions faced by victims, and lack of proper ventilation in a refrigerated container truck, then it should be classified with the glossary code "XXM10XB".
