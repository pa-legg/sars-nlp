Can you please suggest a suitable glossary code classification for the following statement: In the case of Smith & Johnson Solicitors, a prominent legal firm specializing in real estate and financial transactions, two senior partners, John Smith and Emily Johnson, are suspected of professional enabling money laundering. Their case involves a complex web of financial misconduct and legal complicity. The MLRO became suspicious when a series of high-value property transactions linked to offshore shell companies came under scrutiny. These transactions were found to involve large sums of money believed to be the proceeds of criminal activity, including drug trafficking and tax evasion. Further investigation revealed that Smith & Johnson Solicitors have facilitated these transactions by providing legal cover for their clients, despite red flags and insufficient due diligence on the sources of funds.
