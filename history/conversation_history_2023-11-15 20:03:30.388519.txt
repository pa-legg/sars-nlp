######The UK Financial Intelligence Unit (UKFIU), a part of the National Crime Agency, publish the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Glossary Codes and Reporting Routes. Which of the glossary codes would best classify the following report? "I am writing to report a highly suspicious financial activity that has come to our attention, involving an individual's use of Bitcoin mixing services in conjunction with transactions on the darknet. We believe that this activity may be indicative of efforts to obscure the true origin and destination of funds, which is a common practice in illicit activities. Reasons for Suspicion: 1. Bitcoin Mixing: The individual in question has been observed using a Bitcoin mixing service, which deliberately mixes the source of funds to make them more difficult to trace. This is a known technique used to launder illicit funds and obfuscate the source of the cryptocurrency. 2. Darknet Transactions: The Bitcoin mixed funds have been used in transactions on darknet platforms, often associated with the exchange of illegal goods and services, which raises significant red flags regarding the legitimacy of the transactions. 3. Anonymity Measures: The use of aliases, encrypted communications, and the Tor network in conjunction with Bitcoin mixing suggests a concerted effort to maintain anonymity, which is often associated with illegal activities."
