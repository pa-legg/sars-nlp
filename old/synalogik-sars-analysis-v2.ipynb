      "I am writing to report a suspicious real estate transaction that has come to our attention, involving the purchase of a property by an individual using funds originating from an offshore subsidiary organization allegedly owned by the individual's brother. We believe this transaction may warrant further investigation due to several red flags and unusual circumstances.    Reasons for Suspicion:  1. Unusual Funding Source: The source of funds used for this real estate purchase has been traced back to an offshore subsidiary organization owned by the purchaser's brother. The offshore nature of the organization raises concerns about the transparency of the transaction and potential attempts to obscure the true origin of the funds.  2. Lack of Transparency: The involved parties have not provided adequate documentation or justification for the offshore funds used in the transaction. This lack of transparency is concerning, as it may indicate an attempt to avoid regulatory scrutiny or conceal the true source of the funds.  3. Discrepancies in the Transaction: There appear to be inconsistencies and discrepancies in the information provided by the purchaser and other parties involved in the transaction. These inconsistencies raise questions about the legitimacy of the transaction and the accuracy of the information provided.  4. High-Value Transaction: The significant amount involved in this real estate transaction, in combination with the offshore funds, is inconsistent with the known financial history and background of the purchaser. This raises suspicions of potential money laundering or illicit activities. \n"

      "--- QUESTION ---\n",
      "Here is a statement: I am writing to report a suspicious real estate transaction that has come to our attention, involving the purchase of a property by an individual using funds originating from an offshore subsidiary organization allegedly owned by the individual's brother. We believe this transaction may warrant further investigation due to several red flags and unusual circumstances.    Reasons for Suspicion:  1. Unusual Funding Source: The source of funds used for this real estate purchase has been traced back to an offshore subsidiary organization owned by the purchaser's brother. The offshore nature of the organization raises concerns about the transparency of the transaction and potential attempts to obscure the true origin of the funds.  2. Lack of Transparency: The involved parties have not provided adequate documentation or justification for the offshore funds used in the transaction. This lack of transparency is concerning, as it may indicate an attempt to avoid regulatory scrutiny or conceal the true source of the funds.  3. Discrepancies in the Transaction: There appear to be inconsistencies and discrepancies in the information provided by the purchaser and other parties involved in the transaction. These inconsistencies raise questions about the legitimacy of the transaction and the accuracy of the information provided.  4. High-Value Transaction: The significant amount involved in this real estate transaction, in combination with the offshore funds, is inconsistent with the known financial history and background of the purchaser. This raises suspicions of potential money laundering or illicit activities. Glossary codes start with the characters XX followed by 4 or 5 alphanumeric characters.
